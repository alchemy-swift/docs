## Handling Requests

When a request comes through the host & port on which your server is listening, it immediately gets routed to your application You can set up handlers in your application's `boot()` function.

Handlers are defined with the `.on(method:at:handler:)` function, which takes an `HTTPMethod`, a path, and a handler. The handler is a closure that accepts a `Request` and returns a type that conforms to `ResponseConvertable`.

There's sugar for registering handlers for specific methods via `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()`, etc.

```swift
struct ExampleApp: Application {
    func boot() {
        // GET {host}:{port}/hello
        get("/hello") { req in
            "Hello, World!"
        }

        // Handlers can be async and throw errors.
        get("/users") { req in
            try await DB.table("users").get()
        }
    }
}
```

## Returning a Value

Handlers can be asynchronous and throw errors. They should return either a `Response`, something conforming to `ResponseConvertible`, something conforming to `Encodable`, or `Void`.

### `Response`

```swift
app.get("/response") { req in
    Response(status: .ok, body: "Hello from /response")
}
```

### `ResponseConvertible`


```swift
struct User: ResponseConvertible {
    let name: String

    public func response() -> Response {
        Response(status: .ok, body: "Hello, \(name)!")
    }
}
```

```swift
app.get("/response") { req in
    User(name: req["name"])
}
```

### `Encodable`

```swift
/// String
app.get("/string") { req in
    "Howdy!"
}

/// Custom Encodable type
app.get("/todo") { req in
    Todo(name: "Write backend Swift", isDone: true)
}

struct Todo: Encodable {
    let name: String
    let isDone: Bool
}
```

### `Void`

```swift
app.get("/testing_query") { request in
    print("Got params \(request.queryItems)")
}
```

### Chaining Requests

To keep code clean, handlers are chainable.

```swift
let controller = UserController()
app
    .post("/user", handler: controller.create)
    .get("/user", handler: controller.get)
    .put("/user", handler: controller.update)
    .delete("/user", handler: controller.delete)
```

## Error Handling

If a handler throws an error, it will be caught & automatically mapped to a `Response`.

Generic errors will result in an `Response` with a status code of 500, but if any error that conforms to `ResponseConvertible` is thrown, it will be converted as such.

Out of the box, Alchemy provides `HTTPError` which conforms to `ResponseConvertible`. If it is thrown, the response will contain the status code & message of the error.

```swift
struct MyError: Error { ... }

app
    .get("/500") { req in
        // Will result in a 500 response with a generic error message.
        throw MyError()
    }
    .get("/404") { req in
        // Will result in a 404 response with the custom message.
        throw HTTPError(status: .notFound, message: "This endpoint doesn't exist!")
    }
```

### Custom Default Error Handler

By default, unhandled errors will result in a 500 response. If you'd prefer, you can use `setErrorHandler` to return a custom `Response` whenever your app encounters an unhandled error.

```swift
app.setErrorHandler { req, err in
    Response(status: .internalServerError, message: "Uh oh. We've hit a snag.")
}
```

### Custom Not Found Handler

Likewise, use `notFoundHandler` to return a custom `Response` when a request is made that doesn't match any of your app's routes.

```swift
app.notFoundHandler { req in
    Response(status: .notFound, message: "These aren't the bytes you're looking for.")
}
```

## Route Parameters

Dynamic route parameters can be added with a variable name prefaced by a colon (`:`). The value of the parameter can be accessed on the `Request` object.

```swift
app.get("/users/:userId") { req in
    let id = req.parameter("userId", as: Int.self)
}
```

As long as they have different names, a route can have as many path parameters as you'd like.

## Route Groups

You can use `.group()` to add middleware or path prefixes to a specific group of routes.

```swift
app.group(AuthMiddleware())
    .get("/user") { /* will run AuthMiddleware beforehand */ }

app.post("/login") { /* will not run AuthMiddleware */ }
```

There is also a closure based `.group()` that will isolate the prefix or middleware to any handlers defined in the closure. Using the closure based version, the example above would look like so:

```swift
app
    .group(AuthMiddleware()) {
        $0.get("/user") { ... }
    }
    .post("/login")
```

## Route Streaming

By default, Alchemy collects the entire body of a `Request` before a route handler is called. If the request is uploading a large file, this could balloon memory. If you'd like to enable request streaming, pass the `.stream` to a handler's `options` parameter. This will call the handler as soon as the request's body begins streaming so you can handle each chunk as it comes in.

```swift
app.post("/large_file", options: .stream) { req in
    req.body?.stream.readAll { chunk in
        // process chunk
    }
}
```
