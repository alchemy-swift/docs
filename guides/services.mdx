## Introduction

The Alchemy service `Container` manages dependencies and performs dependency injection. Dependency injection is a fancy phrase for "registering" and "resolving" services with a certain interface. Doing so makes your services easier to mock in tests or swap out for various implementations.

Out of the box, your Alchemy app is configured with a variety of essential services. If you need to add more, you can do so directly through your application's `var container: Container`. For larger groups of services and associated logic, you can write a custom [Plugin](#plugins).

## Registering

Registering a service is simple. Just call the `register` function of a container which takes a factory closure that will be used to create a service of that type when it's resolved. The closure has a single `Container` to resolve other services that may be dependencies.

```swift
container.register { container in
    let users = container.require(UsersService.self)
    return AccountsService(users: users)
}
```

For services that don't have any dependencies, you can just pass a value of the service.

<Note>This API uses @autoclosure. The value you pass won't actually be called until the service is resolved.</Note>

```swift
container.register(UsersService())
```

By default, a value is registered to the container as its type. If you'd like to register the value as a type it inherits, such as a protocol, just use `as`.

```swift
container.register(SQLiteDatabase() as Database)
```

Lastly, if you'd just like to register to the main application container (`Container.main`) you can call all of these functions statically.

```swift
container.register(WebhookService())
```

### Identified Services

If you'd like to register multiple instances of a type to the container, you can associate each of them with an identifier. The identifier should be something `Hashable`, like a `String` or `Int`.

```swift
container.regiser(SQLiteDatabase() as Database, id: "sqlite")
```

### Singleton Services

Each time a service is resolved, the factory closure will be called. This will create a new instance of the service for each resolution. If you'd like for to only create a single instance of the type and return that on all subsequent resolutions, add `.singleton()` after registering.

```swift
container.regiser(MailService()).singleton()
```

## Resolving

You can resolve a service using the `resolve()` function. This will return an optional instance of the service, returning `nil` if the service isn't registered.

```swift
let users: UsersService? = container.resolve(UsersService.self)

// The type can be inferred.
let users: UsersService? = container.resolve()
```

If you'd like to enforce that a service has been registered, you can use `resolveOrThrow` which throws an error if the service hasn't been registered.

```swift
do {
    let txs: TransactionsService = try container.resolveOrThrow()
} catch {
    Log.error("TransactionsService not registered!")
}
```

You may also use `require` which will just stop program execution if the service isn't registered.

```swift
let txs: TransactionsService = container.require()
```

### Resolving Identified Services

If you registered your service with an identifier, you'll need to resolve it passing an `id:` parameter to any of the above functions.

```swift
let postgres: Database = Container.require(id: "postgres")
```

### @Inject

For convenience, you can also resolve services with the @Inject property wrapper. When accessed, this resolves a service from the main container.

```swift
struct UsersService {
    @Inject var auth: AuthService
}
```

If your service was registered with an identifier, you'll need to pass that as an argument.

```swift
@Inject("postgres") var db: Database
```

#### @Injecting from a custom container

Sometimes you might not want to inject from the main application container. To do so with `@Inject` you can conform the enclosing type to `Containerized`. This will cause `@Inject` to resolve from the container on the enclosing type.

<Note>`Containerized` requires that the enclosing type is a class.</Note>

```swift
final class AuthService: Containerized {
    // Will be resolved from the `container` property below.
    @Injet var db: Database

    let container: container

    init(container: Container) {
        self.container = container
    }
}
```

### Aliases

For convenience, many of the services that you'll regularly use in Alchemy have a global accessor variable that you can use to quickly inject the default instance. For example, `DB` resolves your app's default `Database`.

```swift
let rows = try await DB.table("users").get()
```

While this may look like a static call, it's actually equivalent to calling `Container.resolve(Database.self)`. Using aliases you can easily use dependency injection without cluttering up your code with a bunch of `Container.resolve(...)` calls.

You can access an identified service this way as well.

```swift
let rows = try await DB("sqlite").table("users").get()
```

#### The `Service` protocol

Many core Alchemy services conform to the `Service` protocol. This gives them an associated identifier type, `Service.Identifier`. You can use this type to create typesafe identifiers for accessing various service instances through aliases.

```swift
extension Database.Identifier {
    static let sqlite: Database.Identifier = "sqlite"
}

let rows = try await DB(.sqlite).table("users").get()
```

#### All Available Aliases

## Plugins

Sometimes, you may want to extend Alchemy with significant functionality. You might be creating a third party library or just building a complex app. You can use plugins to help manage this process.

A Plugin is essentially a type that wraps the registration and lifecycle of a group of services. Under the hood, Alchemy is built almost entirely with plugins - the `Application` type essentially just loads and boots a variety of plugins. You can register additional plugins in your application's configuration.

A plugin has three optional functions - `registerServices(...)`, `boot(...)`, and `shutdownServices(...)`.

### `registerServices`

A plugin should register all services to the application container in this function.

<Warning>Other services from other plugins might not be registered to the container yet, so don't try to access any in this function.</Warning>

### `boot`

The boot function is called after ALL `registerServices` has been called on all plugins. Therefore it is safe to access all services. Here a plugin should perform any startup logic for its registered services. It can also interact with any services from other plugins it might depend on to do things like add routes to the application or add migrations to the default database.

### `shutdownServices`

This is just a hook for a plugin to perform any shutdown logic related to it's services.

## App Lifecycle

Alchemy uses [swift-service-lifecycle](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-service-lifecycle) under the hood to power starting up and shutting down various services. If you need to hook into this, you can do so by resolving `ServiceLifecycle` from the application container or with the `Lifecycle` [alias](#alias).

<Warning>The lifecycle is started immediately after your application's `boot()` function is called. If you need to register a service to the lifecycle's startup, you'll need to do so in that function.</Warning>

```swift App.swift
func boot() {

    // 0. Create the service
    let service = CustomService()

    // 1. Add it to the container.
    Container.register(service).singleton()

    // 2. Hook it up to the app lifecycle.
    Lifecycle.register(
        label: "CustomService",
        start: .async {
            try await service.start()
        },
        shutdown: .async {
            try await service.shutdown()
        }
    )
}
```

## SwiftNIO services

Alchemy is built on top of [Swift NIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) and seamlessly integrates with other NIO based projects from the Swift on the Server ecosystem. Should you need to access these underlying NIO type you can do so through the main application container.

### EventLoopGroup

The main `EventLoopGroup` is accessible via the container or the `LoopGroup` [alias](#aliases).

```swift
// via container
let eventLoopGroup = Container.require(EventLoopGroup.self)

// more simply via alias
let eventLoopGroup = LoopGroup
```

### EventLoop

The current `EventLoop` is accessible via the container or the `Loop` [alias](#aliases).

<Note>
If the code you call this on isn't running on an `EventLoop` the next available `EventLoop` from the main `EventLoopGroup` will be return.
</Note>

```swift
// via container
let eventLoop = Container.require(EventLoop.self)

// via alias
let eventLoop = Loop
```

### NIOThreadPool

Your application's `NIOThreadPool` is accessible via the container or the `Thread` [alias](#aliases).

```swift
// via container
let threadPool = Container.require(NIOThreadPool.self)

// more simply via alias
let threadPool = Thread
```

Alchemy also adds a utility function, `run(...)` to `NIOThreadPool` that provides an async interface for running expensive work on a background thread and then returning the result of the work to the current `EventLoop`.

```swift
let value: LocationSchema = try await Thread.run {
    try JSONDecoder().decode(LocationSchema.self, from: jsonData)
}
```

## Testing

When it comes time to write tests for your app, you can easily mock services by registering an instance appropriate for testing to the `Container`.

```swift
final class UsersServiceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testCreateUser() {
        Container.register(UsersServiceMock() as UsersService)
        ...
    }
}
```
