## Install Swift

To use Alchemy, you'll first need to make sure Swift is installed.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="macOS">
        Install and open the [latest Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Linux">
        Use the official [Linux Swift installer](https://github.com/swift-server/swiftly).
        ```bash
        curl -L https://swift-server.github.io/swiftly/swiftly-install.sh | bash
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Create a Project

Once that's finished, create a new project using the [create Alchemy app script](https://github.com/alchemy-swift/examples/blob/main/create-alchemy-app.sh).

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alchemy-swift/examples/main/create-alchemy-app.sh)
```

## Run the App

Finally, run your app and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser.

```bash
cd {project-name}
swift run app # hang tight, the first build takes a moment
```

## Setup your Editor

There are two main editor options for writing Swift - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Here are some helpful tips for you to get set up with either.

        **Set a custom working directory**

    By default, Xcode builds and runs all projects in a separate directory; `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`. This isn't an issue for iOS apps, but it means that your Alchemy app won't be able to access important assets in your project such as an `.env` file or a `Public/` directory.

    Fortunately this is simple to fix. You just need to tell Xcode to build and run your app in the root directory of your project: `Command + Shift + <` -> `Run` -> `Options` -> `select 'Use custom working directory:'` -> `enter the root directory of your project`.

    **Accessing hidden files**

    You'll likely be configuring your Alchemy app with a `.env` file. Xcode is unable to edit or view hidden files (files prefaced with a `.`). When it comes time to work with these files, you'll need to use a text editor that can access them such as Visual Studio Code.
