## Introduction

Deploying with DigitalOcean is simple and cheap. You'll just need to create a droplet, install Swift, and run your project.

## Deploy to a Droplet

First, create a new droplet with the image of your choice, for this guide we'll use `Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) x64`. You can see the supported Swift [platforms here](https://swift.org/download/#releases).

### Install Swift

Once your droplet is created, ssh into `root@<droplet-public-ip>` and install Swift with the official [Linux Swift installer](https://github.com/swift-server/swiftly).

```bash
curl -L https://swift-server.github.io/swiftly/swiftly-install.sh | bash
```

### Enable Firewall

You'll need to allow HTTP through your droplet's firewall.

```bash
sudo ufw allow http
```

### Run Your App

Now that Swift is installed, you can just run your app. Start by cloning it.

```bash
git clone <project>
```

Then run it on `0.0.0.0:80`. This will make it available from your droplet's public IP.

<Tip>The first time you compile the app it will take a bit, especially if the droplet you created is very small. Future compiles will be much faster.</Tip>

```bash
cd <project>
swift run app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```

Visit `<droplet-public-ip>` in the browser and you'll see your app running.

Nicely done, your project is live on DigitalOcean!
