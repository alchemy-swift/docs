## Introduction

When setting up your Alchemy app, you'll want to configure important services such as databases, job queues, or filesystems. Typically, these will have configuration types that let you isolate your configuration logic. If you got started with the template project, you'll see these in the `Configs/` directory of your app.

```
Configs
├── App+Caches.swift
├── App+Config.swift
├── App+Database.swift
├── App+Filesystems.swift
├── App+Loggers.swift
└── App+Queues.swift
```

All other setup logic, including routing, can go in the `Application.boot()` function which runs after all [Services & Plugins](/guides/services) have loaded.

```swift App.swift
struct App: Application {
    func boot() {
        Log.info("Application is booting.")
        get("/hello") {
            "Hello, \($0["name"])!"
        }
    }
}
```

## General Application Configuration

Out of the box, your application is configured with sensible default settings. You can customize general application settings by overriding your appliation's `var configuration: Configuration`.

```swift Configs/App+Config.swift
extension App {
    var configuration: Configuration {
        Configuration(
            plugins: [
                // Install any custom plugins here.
            ],
            commands: [
                // Define any custom commands here.
            ],
            maxUploadSize: 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 // allow uploads up to 2GB
        )
    }
}
```

### Enable TLS

By default, the server runs over `HTTP/1.1`. You can enable running over TLS with `useHTTPS(...)`.

```swift
func boot() throws {
    try useHTTPS(key: "/path/to/private-key.pem", cert: "/path/to/cert.pem")
}
```

### Enable HTTP/2

You may also configure your server to use `HTTP/2` with `useHTTP2(...)`.

<Tip>`HTTP/2` is only supported over TLS and so automatically uses it. You don't need to call both `useHTTPS` and `useHTTP2`.</Tip>

```swift
func boot() throws {
    try useHTTP2(key: "/path/to/private-key.pem", cert: "/path/to/cert.pem")
}
```

## Environment

You'll often want to change configurations depending on the environment your app is running in. For example, using a different database during local development than in production.

Alchemy makes this easy with the `Environment` type, easily accessed through the `Env` alias. By default when your app boots it will load all process environment variables as well as an optional dotenv file.

### Dotenv Files

A dotenv file is a list of keys & values you'll use to configure your project. You'll typically have one for each environment you want to run your app in such as `local`, `stage`, and `prod`.

The default dotenv file at `.env` includes some common environment variables. Inside your `.env` file, keys & values are separated with an `=`.

<Warning>
    If a variable with the same name exists in both the process environment
    _and_ a loaded dotenv file, the value from the process environment will be
    returned when accessing the Environment.
</Warning>

```ini .env
APP_NAME=Alchemy
APP_KEY=
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=alchemy
DB_USER=josh
DB_PASS=password

REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=
```

### Setting the Environment

The default environment is `local` and loads variables from any file at `.env`. To change this, run your app with the -e {env_name} flag or set `APP_ENV={env_name}` in the process environment. This will set the environment name to `{env_name}` and load variables from a dotenv file at `.env.{env_name}`.

You'll typically have a separate dotenv file for each of your app environments (i.e. local, staging, production).

<CodeGroup>
```bash run.sh
# Run for Local Dev
swift run app
# Start the Stage app
swift run app -e stage
# Start the Prod app
swift run app -e prod
````
```ini .env
APP_DEBUG=true
DB_HOST=localhost
````

```ini .env.stage
APP_DEBUG=true
DB_HOST=stage.database.com
```

```ini .env.prod
APP_DEBUG=false
DB_HOST=prod.database.com
```

</CodeGroup>

### Accessing Environment Variables

To access environment variables, use the `Env` alias to access the current `Environment`. You can use `.get(...)`, subscripts, or @dynamicMemberLookup. You'll have to specify the type that you'd like to convert the result to and the result is always optional.

```swift
// Explicitly specify the type
let isDebug = Env.get("APP_DEBUG", as: Bool.self)

// Access via subscript
let featureEnabled: Int? = Env["FEATURE_ENABLED"]

// Access via @dynamicMemberLookup
let dbPort: Int? = Env.DB_PORT

// Infer the type
let dbHost: String? = Env.get("DB_HOST")

// Infer the type, falling back to a default value
let plaidBaseURL = Env.PLAID_BASE_URL ?? "https://sandbox.plaid.com"
```

## Testing

When your app is run in the context of a test, the default env changes from `local` to `test` and dotenv variables are loaded from `.env.test` if it exists. You should set environment variables appropriate for testing there.

### Detecting if the app is in a test

You can quickly access if your app is running in a test via `Env.isTesting`.

```swift App+Databases.swift
extension App {
    var databases: Databases {
        Databases(
            default: Env.isTesting ? "sqlite" : "postgres",
        )
    }
}
```

### Manually mocking the environment

If you'd like to further customize or mock the Environment during a test, you can mock it in the [application Container](/guides/services).

```swift
func testDatabaseOverride() {
    Container.register(Environment(name: "foo", dotenvVariables: ["DB_DEFAULT": "sqlite"])).singleton()
    XCTAssertEqual(Env.DB_DEFAULT, "sqlite")
}
```
