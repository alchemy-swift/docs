## Introduction

The `Request` object encapsulates incoming HTTP requests to your Alchemy app. It provides a variety of ways to interact with each request's content, queries, files, and more. We will discuss a few of the most important methods below.

## Inspecting the Request

A `Request` object is passed to the handlers of each route you define on your app.

```swift
app.get("/") { request in
    let name = request["name"].string
    // ...
}
```

### Request Path & Method

Each `Request` instance contains an instance of Foundation's `URLComponents` as well as an `HTTPMethod`, `urlComponents` and `method`, respectively. It also contains a few functions and properties for shorthand access to other common values.

#### Accessing The Request URL

You can access the complete url of the request using the `url` field.

```swift
let url: URL = request.url
```

You may also access just the path of the request. In example, the request url is "https://example.com/users/2" `path` will be `/users/2`. Note that path will not include any query from the url.

```swift
let uri = request.path
```

#### Accessing Parameters

You'll often have path parameters in your routes, specified on your router by a path component prefixed with a `:`. To quickly access any path parameters on a request, you may use the `parameter()` function.

```swift
get("/:foo") {
    let foo = request.parameter("foo")
}
```

You may specific the return type to be any implementation of `LosslessStringConvertible` (a type that's initializable from a `String`). This overload of the function has a throwing interface, and will throw if the parameter doesn't exist or isn't convertible.

```swift
get("/:foo/:bar/:baz/:tiz") {
    let string = try request.parameter("foo", as: String.self)
    let int = try request.parameter("bar", as: Int.self)
    let uuid = try request.parameter("baz", as: UUID.self)
    let bool = try request.parameter("tiz", as: Bool.self)
}
```

If you'd like to iterate over each parameter, you may access the `parameters` property. Each `Parameter` has a `key` and `value`, representing the path placeholder and the actual component string, respectively.

```swift
for p in request.parameters {
    print("Parameter \(p.key): \(p.value).")
}
```

#### Retreiving The Request Method

You may access the request's method via the `method` property.

```swift
let method = request.method

if request.method == .POST {
    //
}
```

### Request Headers

You can grab a single header value from a request using the `header()` function.

```swift
let authorization = request.header("Authorization")
```

The `header()` function returns the first matching header value, if one exists. If you'd like to access multiple values of the same header, you may use the `headers` parameter, an instance of `HTTPHeaders`.

```swift
// Loop through all X-Foo headers
for value in headers["X-Foo"] {
    print("X-Foo: \(value)")
}

// Loop through all headers on the request
for h in headers {
    print("\(h.name): \(h.value)")
}
```

### Retrieving Values From The Query String

Values in the query string is easily accessible via the `query()` function.

```swift
let page = request.query("page")
```

### Request IP Address

You may access the remote address of the incoming response via the `remoteAddress` field, an instance of swift-nio's `SocketAddress?`.

```swift
let socket = request.remoteAddress
switch socket {
    case .unixDomainSocket(let path):
        //
    case .v4(let ip):
        //
    case .v6(let ip):
        //
}
```

If you'd prefer to just access the ip address `String`, use `ip`.

```swift
let ip = request.ip
```

## Content

Incoming requests will often have content in the request body. You can access the raw body data via the `request.body` property, but Alchemy includes a few higher level interfaces for interacting with the request content.

### Decoding Codable Types

Typically, incoming requests will have their body encoded in one of a few common encoding standards, as indicated by the `Content-Type` header. Out of the box, Alchemy lets you decode Swift `Codable` types from requests encoded by `multipart/form-data`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and `application/json`.

```swift
struct User: Codable {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    let birthday: Date
}

let user: User = try jsonEncodedRequest.decode(User.self)
```

The `decode()` function automatically detects the right decoder to use based on the `Content-Type` header, but you may pass it a specific decoder if you'd like to specify additional options.

```swift
let formDecoder = URLEncodedFormDecoder(dateDecodingStrategy: .iso8601)
let user: User = try formEncodedRequest.decode(User.self, with: formDecoder)
```

#### Writing A Custom Decoder

If you'd like to use the decoding APIs with a unsupported content type, you'll need to write a custom implementation of `ContentDecoder` and pass it to the `decode()` function.

```swift
struct XMLDecoder: ContentDecoder { ... }

let user: User = xmlEncodedRequest.decode(User.self, with: XMLDecoder())
```

### Accessing Specific Fields

While decoding can be a great way to quickly validate incoming requests against a complicated schema, it can be brittle and requires a custom type for decoding all types. To simplify cases where you only need a single field or two, you may use the `Content` API, which seamlessly integrates a dictionary-like lookup style and Swift's `Codable`.

#### Retreiving Content At A Specific Path

You may access a request's content with the `content()` function or through subscripting directly on `Request`. Subscripts can be either `String`s for fields or `Int`s for array index access.

```swift
let page = request.content()["page"]
let page = request["page"]
let user = request["users"][0]
```

You may also use dynamic member lookup.

```swift
let name = request.users.0.name
```

#### Checking If A Value Exists

You may confirm that a value exists at the given path using the `exists` property.

```swift
if request.users[10].exists {
    //
}
```

#### Checking For Null

A value that exists but is `null` can be checked for using the `isNull` property.

```swift
guard !request.users[0].address.city.isNull else {
    //
}
```

### Retrieving Data

Once you've accessed the content at the proper path, there are a few variables and functions to help convert that data to a desired type.

#### Retreiving A Value

You may retrive a value from the content at a specific path using the `string`, `int`, `bool`, `double`, and `array` properties. Each has a throwing version as well.

```swift
let name: String? = request.users[0].name.string
let age: String? = request.users[0].age.int
let isAdmin: Bool? = request.users[0].isAdmin.bool
let height: Double? = request.users[0].height.double
let users: [Content]? = request.users.array
```

Each property has a throwing version as well that throws if there is an error converting or if the value doesn't exist.

```swift
let name: String = try request.users[0].name.stringThrowing
let age: String = try request.users[0].age.intThrowing
```

#### Decoding A Value

You may also combine the dynamic interface of `Content` with the typesafe interface of `Codable` by calling `decode()` on content at the given path.

```swift
let user: User = try request.users[0].decode(User.self)
```

### Dot Notation

When working with content that's an array, you may subscript with the `*` operator to "flatten" it, often called "dot" notation. This returns an array of `Content` and subsequent subscripts will be applied to _each_ element.

```swift
let userNames: [String]? = request.users[*].name.string
```

#### Dictionaries / Objects

Dot notation is also applicable to dictionaries/objects in your content, and will map each key/value pair to the value.

```swift
/*
 {
     "foo": "value",
     "bar": 2,
     "baz": false,
 }
 */
let request = ...

let values: [Content]? = request[*]
values![0].string // "value"
values![1].int // 2
values![2].bool // false
```

## Files

### Retrieving Uploaded Files

You may quickly retrieve any files uploaded as part of the request using the `file()` method, or by using the `file`/`fileThrowing` properties on `Content`. These return an instance of type `File` which provides a variety of utilities for interacting with the file.

```swift
let file: File? = request.file("photo")

let file: File? = request.photo.file
```

#### Accessing The File Content Type

If the file was uploaded with a `Content-Type` header, you may access it with the `contentType` property.

```swift
let contentType = request.file("photo").contentType
```

### Storing Uploaded Files

To store an uploaded file, you'll want to put it in one of your [filesystems](storage.md). You can use File's `store()` function to do so easily. It accepts an optional directory to put the file in, as well as an optional id of the filesystem to store in. By default, it will be stored in your default filesystem.

```swift
try await request.file("photo").store()

try await request.file("photo").store(in: "users/photos")

try await request.file("photo").store(in: "users/photos", on: .s3)
```
