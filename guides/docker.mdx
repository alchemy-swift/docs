## Docker

You can use Docker to create an image that will be deployable anywhere Docker is usable.

### Create a Dockerfile

Start off by creating a `Dockerfile`. This is a file that tells Docker how to build & run an image with your server.

Here's a sample one to copy and paste. Note that you may have to change `Backend` to the name of your executable product.

This file tells docker to use a base image of `swift:latest`, build your project, and, when the image is run, run your executable on host 0.0.0.0 at port 3000

```dockerfile
FROM swift:latest
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN swift build -c release -Xswiftc -g
RUN mkdir /app/bin
RUN mv `swift build -c release --show-bin-path` /app/bin
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ./bin/release/Backend --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

### Build and deploy the image

Now build your image. If you've been running your project from the CLI, there may be a hefty `.build` folder. You might want to nuke that before running `docker build` so that you don't need to wait to pass that unneeded directory to Docker.

```shell
$ docker build .
...
Successfully built ab21d0f26ecd
```

Finally, run the built image. Pass in `-d` to tell Docker to run your image in the background and `-p 3000:3000` to tell it that your container's 3000 port should be exposed to your machine.

```shell
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 ab21d0f26ecd
```

Visit `http://0.0.0.0:3000/hello` in the browser and you should see

```
Hello, World!
```

Awesome! You're ready to deploy with Docker.
