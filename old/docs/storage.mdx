## Serving Static Files

If you'd like to serve files from a static directory, there's a `Middleware` for that. It will match incoming requests to files in the directory, streaming those back to the client if they exist. By default, it serves from `Public/` but you may pass a custom path in the initializer if you like.

Consider a `Public` directory in your project with a few files.

```
│
├── Public
│   ├── css
│   │   └── style.css
│   ├── js
│   │   └── app.js
│   ├── images
│   │   └── puppy.png
│   └── index.html
│
├── Sources
├── Tests
└── Package.swift
```

You could use the following code to serve files from that directory.

```swift
app.useAll(StaticFileMiddleware())
```

Now, assets in the `Public/` directory can be requested.

```
http://localhost:3000/index.html
http://localhost:3000/css/style.css
http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/images/puppy.png
http://localhost:3000/ (by default, will return any `index.html` file)
```

**Note**: The given directory is relative to your server's working directory. If you are using Xcode, be sure to [set a custom working directory](../getting-started/1_configuration.md#setting-a-custom-working-directory) for your project where the static file directory is.
